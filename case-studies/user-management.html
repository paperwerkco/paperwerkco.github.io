				The problem
			</h3>
			<p>
				The Learnosity Console is a self-service tool to help account admins manage their account settings and users. The product team identified a few problems that were negatively impacting the experience of creating new users for user managers:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Required steps were unclear and therefore missed by the user manager in the user creation process</li>
				<li>When these steps were missed the user was unaware and therefore continued as normal, providing the details to their new user</li>
				<li>When their new user tried to log in they received a generic error which did not allow them to log in</li>
				<li>The customers user would then need to notify the user manager who would then need to contact our support team as it was unclear what the issue was</li>
				<li>This process was frustrating to the user manager and their user but also was a burden on our own support team</li>
			</ul>

				My Role – UX design and research
			</h3>
			<p>
				For this project I was the lead designer and was responsible for:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reviewing the existing research</li>
				<li>Brainstorming the problem space and solution ideas with the product team</li>
				<li>Design exploration and wireframing</li>
				<li>Prototyping</li>
				<li>User flows</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The product team started looking at user management as a whole and brought together all of the existing research to identify problem areas. These were then prioritized as a team by looking at the problems that, if solved, would have the most impact and were feasible. The create user flow was prioritized because the problem happened often, impacted multiple user types, and was a blocker to users self-servicing.

				Learnings and reflections
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				This project was a great example of a product team prioritizing stories of from a larger epic in order to achieve the most impactful outcome for our customers. Through our brainstorming sessions we were able to explore different ideas around user management, create a shared understanding around the problem, and choose from a great list of worthy improvements.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Although the create user task is seemingly small, it was a task that impacted many users on our customer's side and our support team. When it was released and unprompted, a power user shared their feedback:  
			</p>
			<p class="quote">
				"I like the improvements you made to the user management area in authoring! I was just setting up a new user! Thanks so much.""
