				Design comes in many forms and can add a moment of beauty in someones life, make doing the necessities easier, or be worn and used among many things. I have had the pleasure of working on different design projects in my experience that touch a few of these areas. Here are a few of my favorites.

				This project was a really exciting one as it was my first large scale book project. I had worked on smaller image books and many, many large catalogs before but this project gave me the creative reigns to put my typography skills and proofing eye to the test.
			</p>
			<p>
				My client put a lot of careful consideration into to each and every excerpt that was included in this anthology and I wanted to make sure the choices I made around typefaces, typesetting, and layout design made the experience of reading this book around a campfire as delightful as possible. I learned about systematic styling in typesetting referencing heavily the Chicago Manual of Style. I also learned about different printing techniques and enhancements like the french fold book cover and line length best practices for reading.

				A fun branding project for Vicki Meintjes: The sweetmaker. Vicki makes beautiful cakes and desserts and wanted her brandmark and typography to reflect them well.
			</p>
			<p>
				The favorite brand mark shape was based off broken honeycomb she uses to style the desserts.

						Selection of graphics for Cotton On's Run Australia event branding and collateral.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				In 2016, I was brought on board as a contractor to work on Cotton On's Run Australia event branding and collateral. The style of the RUN brandmark was inspired by the branding for the 1968 olympics in Mexico.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this project I needed to design, create brand guidleines and manage over 100 individual assets for social media, printed merchandise, large format banners and signage, wayfinding, and the course maps for runners to follow on the day.
