					My background
				</h1>
				<p>
					I live in NYC and work as a Product Designer doing UI and UX design as well as user research. I’m currently working at Learnosity, a white-labelled B2B SaaS product that provides the building blocks for online assessments. I love drawing, painting, hanging out with my doggie Nelson, and spending time with my family.

				<p>
					I’ve always known I wanted to be a designer and I’ve always liked people, ideas, and being creative. In my 20's, I took some free community college CSS classes and started building Wordpress websites for local restaurants. I loved eating out and realised the restaurant websites didn’t capture how good the restaurant actually was and there was room for improvement. I did this purely out of interest and had no idea at the time this would be the first step on my career path.
				</p>
				<p>
					That website work led to varied design experiences including designing skateboarding apparel, FMCG goods, designing for non-profit fundraising, and over the past 5 years product design, UX and user research, currently in the edtech space.
				</p>
				<p>
					The diversity of my experience means I’ve learned so much from so many;  good design from inspiring creative directors; meaningful stakeholder engagement from government service leaders; principles of development, maintainability and standards from my developer colleagues; and how to actively listen and engage with the people who use the products and services I design.   	
				</p>
				<p>
					This work has also meant I’ve discovered how I add value to teams and organizations. I’m driven by a love of improvement through design, whether it’s by driving the <a href="/case-studies/design-system.html">start of a design system</a>, to help designers and developers focus on the hard problems, developing <a href="/case-studies/persona-cards.html">usable personas</a> to help me and my colleagues understand and build products for the people that we are creating products for, or using design to build annotation tools for students that meet the business requirements but also meet user needs. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My passion helps me be a catalyst for process change and collaboration and my genuine love of people and improvement means I never stop learning. I’m stay connected in international design and research communities and find them to be an invaluable resource for growth, development and exciting new ideas. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I’d love to connect—please reach out and don’t be a stranger!
