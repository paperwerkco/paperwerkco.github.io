					My background
				</h1>
				<p>
					I currently reside in NYC and work as a Product Designer doing UI and UX design as well as user research for Learnosity, a white-labelled B2B SaaS product that provides the building blocks for online assessments. I love drawing, painting, hanging out with my doggie Nelson, and spending time with my family.
				</p>	
				<p>
					I always knew I wanted to be a designer, although when I was five years old it was a fashion designer, but I always knew I liked people, ideas, and being creative. In my 20's, me and my brother took some free community college CSS classes and started building Wordpress websites for local restaurants. The idea came from loving to go out to eat and finding that the restaurant websites didnt capture how good the restaurant actually was. Little did I know that this would be my first endeavor into my career.
				</p>
				<p>
					My work has taken me from those websites to skateboarding apparel, FMCG goods, designing for non-profit fundraising, and currently product design, UX and user research in the edtech space. These experiences have given me the opportunity to learn about t good design from inspiring creative directors, stakeholder management from leaders in government services, principles of development, maintainability and standards from my developer colleagues, and how to listen and learn from the people impacted by the products I design and the services my organization engages them in.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this work I have also discovered the things that engage me, namely people and processes inside and outside my organization. I have been able to be a catalyst for process change and collaboration. Making things better drives me, whether it be creating effective ,useful standards and guidelines to support individuals to create great products or designing a two-factor authentication experience that helps a user work securely without getting in their way.   	
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a strong believer in always learning and have found the international design and research communities to be an invaluable resource for learning and growth. My two most recent projects, building the foundations of a design system and uncovering potential improvements we could make for our customer developers were greatly improved by the knowledge I gained from these resources over the last few years.
